          <h3>About Bangladesh Padma Brize</h3>
          <p>
            On 18 September 1998, a project worth Tk. 3,843.50 crore was
            proposed for the construction of a bridge over the Padma River on
            the Dhaka-Mawa-Bhanga-Khulna Highway with the aim of establishing
            direct communication between the capital and the south and southwest
            of the country. At 5 km long and 18.10 m wide, this bridge is
            considered to be the longest possible bridge in the country.
            Construction was proposed to begin in July 1999 and be completed in
            June 2004. The proposed amount of Taka 2,893.50 crore was from
            foreign sources and Taka 750 crore from local sources.[11] In the
            2006-2007 Annual Development Program, the then Government of
            Bangladesh adopted a plan to build the Padma Multipurpose
            Bridge.[12] The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) invited the
            pre-qualification tender for the project in April 2010. Construction
            of the bridge was expected to commence by early 2011[13] and be
            ready for major completion in 2013 (and complete all sections by
            late 2015[14][unreliable source?]). After allegations of corruption
            by some people associated with the project's preparation, the World
            Bank withdrew its commitment and other donors followed. The
            Government of Bangladesh then decided to fund the project itself.[8]
            China proposed building the bridge on the build-operate-transfer
            (BOT) basis by investing $2 billion or 70 percent of the project
            cost. Four companies—China Major Bridge Engineering Company,
            Daelim-L&T JV and Samsung C&T Corporation—purchased the tender
            papers. However, only the Chinese company submitted their financial
            proposal on 24 April 2014. On 17 June 2014, important progress had
            been made in the construction of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge. A
            construction firm, China Major Bridge Engineering Company Ltd, was
            selected to construct the long aspired bridge on the river Padma.
            The 6.15 km bridge cost an estimated ৳91.72 billion (US$1.1
            billion).

      <p>
        Mujibnagar is a prominent tourist destination in Bangladesh, given its
        historical significance as the city where the first independent
        government of Bangladesh swore oath in 1971. The new railway line will
        allow tourists from across Bangladesh and the rest of the world to visit
        the site. SMEC’s role in the project is to prepare the design for the
        new railway line, along with a feasibility study. The firm will also
        tender services and conduct the research and mathematical modeling for
        the project. SMEC will be looking to use its expertise in project
        management and infrastructure across a variety of domains to support
        both projects. “This adds to the considerable rail portfolio that SMEC
        has been developing in Bangladesh and India, where we are also working
        on the Chennai metro, the dedicated freight corridor and on Mumbai Metro
        Line 6. In Bangladesh, SMEC is delivering the Subregional Transport
        Project Preparatory Facility: Rail Component, 120 km
        Dhaka-Chittagong-Cox’s Bazar line, and 215.22 km Padma Bridge Rail Link
        Project,” said Janardhan Sundaran, Executive Director at SMEC India. He
        also highlighted the contribution of the new projects to the community.
        “These important infrastructure works will also contribute to economic
        growth and community livelihoods through improved transport,” he added.

      <h3>About Bangladesh</h3>

        My country’s name is Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a very small country huge
        population. It is a medium-developed country in South Asia. We have a
        very good and progressing economy. It has an area of 147,570 square
        kilometers. But it has a population of 164 million. That is huge than
        the area. But it is still a very beautiful and peaceful country. People
        of Bangladesh are so friendly with each other. This country has a
        glorious history of independence. We got independence from Pakistan in
        1971 after nine mothers’ blood-shedding war. More than 3 million
        Bangladeshi sacrificed their life in that genocide. But still, we were
        able to get our independence. After independence, the newly born country
        faced lots of hard times and struggles. But it rises very well. Now
        Bangladesh is one of the best countries to live in South Asia. There are
        so many beautiful spots to see in this country. We have the longest sea
        beach in the world, cox’s bazaar. The Sundarban is one of the biggest
        mangrove forests in the entire world and a huge source of beauty. You
        can find Royal Bengal Tiger there. I love my country very much. I am so
        lucky to born here.
