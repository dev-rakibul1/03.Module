          <h3>About Bangladesh Padma Brize</h3>
          <p>
            On 18 September 1998, a project worth Tk. 3,843.50 crore was
            proposed for the construction of a bridge over the Padma River on
            the Dhaka-Mawa-Bhanga-Khulna Highway with the aim of establishing
            direct communication between the capital and the south and southwest
            of the country. At 5 km long and 18.10 m wide, this bridge is
            considered to be the longest possible bridge in the country.
            Construction was proposed to begin in July 1999 and be completed in
            June 2004. The proposed amount of Taka 2,893.50 crore was from
            foreign sources and Taka 750 crore from local sources.[11] In the
            2006-2007 Annual Development Program, the then Government of
            Bangladesh adopted a plan to build the Padma Multipurpose
            Bridge.[12] The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) invited the
            pre-qualification tender for the project in April 2010. Construction
            of the bridge was expected to commence by early 2011[13] and be
            ready for major completion in 2013 (and complete all sections by
            late 2015[14][unreliable source?]). After allegations of corruption
            by some people associated with the project's preparation, the World
            Bank withdrew its commitment and other donors followed. The
            Government of Bangladesh then decided to fund the project itself.[8]
            China proposed building the bridge on the build-operate-transfer
            (BOT) basis by investing $2 billion or 70 percent of the project
            cost. Four companies—China Major Bridge Engineering Company,
            Daelim-L&T JV and Samsung C&T Corporation—purchased the tender
            papers. However, only the Chinese company submitted their financial
            proposal on 24 April 2014. On 17 June 2014, important progress had
            been made in the construction of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge. A
            construction firm, China Major Bridge Engineering Company Ltd, was
            selected to construct the long aspired bridge on the river Padma.
            The 6.15 km bridge cost an estimated ৳91.72 billion (US$1.1
            billion).

          <h3>About Bangladesh Railway</h3>
          <p>
            Mujibnagar is a prominent tourist destination in Bangladesh, given
            its historical significance as the city where the first independent
            government of Bangladesh swore oath in 1971. The new railway line
            will allow tourists from across Bangladesh and the rest of the world
            to visit the site. SMEC’s role in the project is to prepare the
            design for the new railway line, along with a feasibility study. The
            firm will also tender services and conduct the research and
            mathematical modeling for the project. SMEC will be looking to use
            its expertise in project management and infrastructure across a
            variety of domains to support both projects. “This adds to the
            considerable rail portfolio that SMEC has been developing in
            Bangladesh and India, where we are also working on the Chennai
            metro, the dedicated freight corridor and on Mumbai Metro Line 6. In
            Bangladesh, SMEC is delivering the Subregional Transport Project
            Preparatory Facility: Rail Component, 120 km Dhaka-Chittagong-Cox’s
            Bazar line, and 215.22 km Padma Bridge Rail Link Project,” said
            Janardhan Sundaran, Executive Director at SMEC India. He also
            highlighted the contribution of the new projects to the community.
            “These important infrastructure works will also contribute to
            economic growth and community livelihoods through improved
            transport,” he added.
